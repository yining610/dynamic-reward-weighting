MATH_INSTRUCTION = """Given the weight for each reward function, generate a response that maximizes the weighted sum of the rewards.
Accuracy [weight={accuracy:.3f}]: the response should be correct and match the ground truth.
Concise [weight={concise:.3f}]: the response should be brief.
Format [weight={format:.3f}]: the response should have clear step-by-step thinking process and the final answer is in \\boxed{{}}."""
